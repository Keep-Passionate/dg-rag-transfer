# DocLayNet-MetaQA

DocLayNet-MetaQA is a DocBench-style meta-data QA set derived from the published DocLayNet human layout annotations. DocLayNet itself is a document layout analysis benchmark, not a QA benchmark. We use its annotations only as gold labels.

Recommended paper wording:

> We derive page/document-level structural QA instances from the human layout annotations of DocLayNet to test deterministic counting beyond DocBench.

Do not describe it as an existing QA benchmark.

## QA Templates

Each selected document receives up to five `type="meta-data"` questions:

- `How many pages does this document have?`
- `How many tables are in this document?`
- `How many figures are in this document?`
- `How many equations are in this document?`
- `How many section headers are in this document?`

Gold labels come from DocLayNet page metadata and human layout annotations.

## Server Usage

```bash
source /etc/network_turbo || true
cd /root/autodl-tmp/dg-rag-transfer || exit 1
git pull --ff-only origin main

/root/miniconda3/envs/rag/bin/pip show pillow >/dev/null 2>&1 || \
  /root/miniconda3/envs/rag/bin/pip install -q pillow
/root/miniconda3/envs/rag/bin/pip show remotezip >/dev/null 2>&1 || \
  /root/miniconda3/envs/rag/bin/pip install -q remotezip

nohup /root/miniconda3/envs/rag/bin/python doclaynet/build_doclaynet_metaqa.py \
  --selective-download \
  --split val \
  --limit-docs 80 \
  --out /root/autodl-tmp/DocLayNet_MetaQA \
  > /root/autodl-tmp/doclaynet_metaqa_build.log 2>&1 &

tail -f /root/autodl-tmp/doclaynet_metaqa_build.log
```

The output follows the DocBench directory convention:

```text
DocLayNet_MetaQA/
  manifest.json
  dataset_card.json
  dl_val_0001_xxxxxxxx/
    dl_val_0001_xxxxxxxx.pdf
    dl_val_0001_xxxxxxxx_qa.jsonl
    meta.json
```

## Notes

- `--selective-download` avoids downloading the full 28GB DocLayNet archive. It reads only `COCO/<split>.json` and the selected PNG pages from the remote zip via HTTP range requests.
- `--include-zero` includes zero-count element questions. The default omits zero-count element questions but always keeps page count.
- `--require-any Table,Picture,Formula,Section-header` keeps documents with at least one useful structural element.
- Generated PDFs are made from DocLayNet page PNGs. The DocLayNet annotations are not written into the PDFs and should not be used as inference input.
